Why were tachos designed on blockchain networks?

Because Blockchain is a common, real-time, encrypted, and decentralized electronic record system for processing and recording financial transactions, contracts, physical assets, supply chain information, etc. There is no single person or entity responsible for the entire chain, rather it is open and everyone in the chain can see the details of each record or block, and track information over a secure network that does not require third- party verification.

Maintain tamper-resistant lists of ever-growing data records, and allow the secure exchange of valuables such as money, shares, or data access rights. Contrary to traditional trading systems, there is no need for a middleman or a central registration system to follow up the exchange movement, but all parties deal directly with each other.
